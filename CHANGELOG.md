## [1.7.0] - 2024-10-29

Completely inconsequential update from the user's perspective, with only
upstream dependencies changed. From an admin or developer of the Commlink
system, the addition of [Laravel Pulse](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pulse)
and [Laravel Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/telescope) should give
more insights into how the system is running. Adding Docker support is a pretty
big win for running Commlink on my non-production hardware.

### Added

- Added Docker setup for Commlink so developers can run things on laptops. ([#1565](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1565), [#1724](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1724))
- Added option to add a role to a user created via the CreateUser script. ([#1566](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1566))
- Added command to create a roll for a specific module via module:make-roll. ([#1567](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1567))
- Added Laravel Pulse dashboard. ([#1571](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1571))
- Added Laravel Telescope. ([#1592](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1592))

### Fixed

- Updated the stub file for creating rolls through make:roll. ([#1567](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1567))
- Restore the GM screen. ([#1572](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1572), [#1515](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1515))
- Fixed editorconfig to have correct indentation for YAML files. ([#1608](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1608))

### Changed

- Updated so many dependencies.
- Move data file for Chummer5 paths into the import command. ([#1561](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1561))


## [1.6.0] - 2024-08-02

### Added

- Re-added Sentry monitoring. ([#1514](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1514))
- Initial support for rolling dice from a web interface. Skills on the Alien character sheet are now clickable, causing a roll event to happen. ([#1521](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1521))
- Add dice rollers for some RPG systems:
    - Blister Critters ([#1522](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1522))
    - Shadowrun Anarchy ([#1527](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1527))

- Fixed rendering of partial Avatar campaigns, giving default experience. ([#1520](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1520))
- Fix trying to create a character for an RPG that hasn't (yet) defined a character class. This basically only happens in factories generating a random character, but was causing tests to fail. ([#1530](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1530))

### Changed

- Lots of dependencies updated.
- Finished modularizing. All of the remaining resources, rules, etc are now in their module's namespace instead of the root namespace. ([#1512](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1512), [#1368](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1368))
- Added php-cs-fixer rule to bar PHPdoc tags that are redundant according to type hints. ([#1525](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1525))

### Changed

- Lots of Composer and NPM dependencies updated.
- Updated a lot of Psalm annotations. ([#1467](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1467))

For example instead of having subdirectories for each RPG under the Roll directory, each RPG's module now has a Roll directory with its dice rollers. ([#1429](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1429))
- Standardized PHPUnit group annotations.

### Removed

- Building unused artifacts for code coverage in CI pipeline. ([#1469](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1469))

## [1.4.0] - 2024-06-21

- Add `apis.json` for API findability. ([#1270](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1270))
- Add command for importing Shadowrun 5th Edition data files from [Chummer 5](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a). ([#216](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/216))

- Parallelize PHP-cs-fixer. ([#1371](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1371))

- Upgraded PHPUnit to v11. This required changing a ton of work, including changing from annotations to attributes, removing redundant annotations, changing from `createStub()` to `createMock()` when the test doubles have expectations, and removing some psalm plugins that don't play well. ([#1363](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1363))
- Upgraded Laravel to v11. ([#1362](https://github.com/omnicolor/commlink/pull/1362))
