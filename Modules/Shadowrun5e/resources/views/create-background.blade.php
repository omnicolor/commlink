                These questions are to help you understand your character
                better, as well as for your GM to understand it. They help your
                GM tailor the game to the characters. The more thoughtful and
                complete you make the answers, the better. At a minimum, they'll
                help you roleplay your character better. In addition, if you
                have a rich history for your character, your GM is more likely
                to give your character more spotlight to shine in.
            </p>

            <p>
                All questions are completely optional, but it recommended that
                you at least give them some thought for your character!

                        grumpy, flirtatious, or just plain weird? Does she have
                        social skills, or is she uncomfortable relating to
                        others? Is she opinionated, easygoing, or downright
                        apathetic? How do others tend to see her?
