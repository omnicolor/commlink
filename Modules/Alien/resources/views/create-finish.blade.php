                <div class="form-text">
                    The ALIEN roleplaying game is about a small group of
                    people facing unknown and horrifying dangers in the cold
                    darkness of space. To survive, you need to find someone
                    to trust, but also be careful who you turn your back to.
                    In game terms, your PC can have one Buddy and one Rival
                    amongst the other PCs. You can only have one of each.
                    Your relationships are important for the GM, as she can
                    use them to create interesting situations in the game.
                    In Campaign play, you can choose one PC to be your Buddy
                    and another to be your Rival.
