Hermeticists take a scientific approach to magic, rigorously staging trial after trial, lab test after lab test to build a better understanding of the underpinnings of logic. It should not be surprising that the faculties of the most prominent thaumaturgical universities in the world are heavily staffed by hermetic mages. Hermeticists see themselves as part of a long, proud tradition of striving to understand the laws undergirding the world and manipulate them. They are more than happy to point out that Isaac Newton’s alchemical studies took up more of his time than his work on physics, and that people like John Dee and Aleister Crowley, who were pushed to the margins of academia, had their reputations dramatically upgraded after the Awakening. Since hermeticists feel they understand magic, they think that puts them ahead of any other branch of academia, since others’ understanding is rooted in this world only. This strongly contributes to their reputation for snobbery and arrogance, a reputation they tend to embrace through the concept that it’s not arrogance if you can back it up.',
