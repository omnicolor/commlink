It is used in Sprint tests (p. 44) and Full Defense Actions (p. 43), and it is an attack skill for thrown weapons. In general, it is paired with Agility to express a certain fluidity of movement, but it also can be linked to Strength for tests when sheer muscle power is needed.

Building and repairing both follow the same basic process—roll an Engineering + Logic Extended test, with the threshold determined by the complexity of the item being built/repaired (see Build/Repair Threshold table) and the interval is based on the complexity of the effort (see Build/Repair Interval table).||Juryrigging is a Simple test, meant to get something to work in the short term with a quick adjustment or even a swift kick. Make an Engineering + Intuition test, using the Threshold Guidelines as a guide instead of the Build/Repair Threshold. If the test is successful, the device functions for (net hits) minutes. Once it stops functioning, another Juryrigging test may be attempted, but the threshold should be at least 1 higher than the previous test, and possibly more depending on how much wear and tear the machine absorbed in its juryrigged state.||Engineering is also used to pick mechanical locks and maglocks.
