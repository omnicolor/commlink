      requestBody:
        description: |
          This is a JSON patch document describing what should happen to the
          character sheet.

          Healing a character is done by setting the appropriate damage track
          to 0.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/damagePhysical", "value": 0}
            ]
          }
          ```

          Damaging a character is done by setting the total damage to a given
          track. If they already had 6 stun, this would give them an additional
          4 boxes of stun.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/damageStun", "value": 10}
            ]
          }
          ```
          Applying more stun damage to a character than their condition monitor
          allows automatically converts to the appropriate amount of additional
          physical damage. Similarly, adding more physical damage than their
          physical monitor allows converts to overflow damage.

          Using edge is similar. If a character starts with 3 edge and uses one,
          set the edgeCurrent field to 2.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/edgeCurrent", "value": 2}
            ]
          }

          Standard issue for the USCMC, the Mk.35 is an unfortunately bulky
          combat pressure suit with a cumbersome recycler unit. You want to be
          careful wearing one of these in a fight, as the hard joints tend to
          seize up with extreme motion. While the inexpensive suit offers full
          protection from the vacuum of space, you have to spend time in a
          decompression chamber after spacewalking in one. Basically, this suit
          sucks, but if the choice is a Mk.35 or the cold of space, shut up and
          suit up. Armor Rating 5, Maximum Air Supply 4. Heavy item.

              Between fights, you release the tension in your team with some

          in use from the 2100-2120s. This tool was originally improvised as a
          weapon by the J’Har rebels during the 2106 uprising on Torin Prime.
          Always one to find profit in anything, Weyland-Yutani studied the
          modifications after the war and made them the standard self-defense
          armament on their commercial fleet.

          Doomed is the status for when you’re drowning, or when you’re on fire,
          or when the stone around you isn’t simply immobilizing you—it’s
          crushing you. It represents a constant, ongoing pressure upon you,
          causing you to mark fatigue at a steady rate until you are free. The
          GM decides exactly how often you mark fatigue during play, unless
          you’re in exchanges—then, you should mark 1-fatigue at the beginning
          of each exchange. Remember that if you can’t mark more fatigue, you
          mark conditions instead.

          Much of the time, you can’t be Doomed unless you’re first Impaired, or
          Impaired and Trapped. You won’t be drowning unless something holds you
          in the water; you won’t be slowly crushed by rock without first being
          trapped in rock. But sometimes it’s appropriate—your entire outfit,
          head to toe, can be set on fire by an angry firebending master without
          warning!

        examples: |
          At a Base 10, you can manage the books for a small company by yourself
          and rarely make any clerical errors. At a Base 14, you can manage the
          books for a medium-sized Corp and hide your embezzlement at the same
          time. At a Base 18, you're a master at double entry and offshore
          accounting that would make the best white collar criminals proud.
          You'll probably be sought out by a Corp or a Crime Family to help them
          with their operations.

            Born in the Martian Congressional Republic, your life has been
            influenced by the Martian dream: to terraform the Red Planet into a
            lush and life-sustaining garden. Like the generations before you,
            you know that you will likely never see the completion of this work
            in your lifetime. As a Martian, your character has the following
            traits:||• Your native gravity is low, the gravity of Mars rather
            than Earth. Martians are more comfortable with microgravity than
            Earthers, and better able to tolerate a full 1 g than Belters,
            operating in-between.

            A measure of comfort and security comes with the middle class. A
            steady job, often skilled labor or “white collar,” supplies the
            means to afford a few luxuries or non-essentials. Middle class
            characters might start off as a bit insular. They often separate
            themselves from the struggles of the lower social classes, focusing
            on the climb towards upper class status. Sometimes that climb leads
            to a slip. They tumble down to the lower class or even become
            outsiders. Some settle for stability instead, and prefer not to rock
            the boat.

          Hard, usually physical, labor and precarious employment tend to rule

          that separates them from becoming outsiders, so they cling to it.
          Lower class characters often depend on family and friends to help keep
          them out of utter poverty. They might live in failing industrial
          areas, inner city slums, or hardscrabble farms. In all cases, they
          make do with what is available and find ways to stretch out resources
          until the next payday or job comes along.

          There are cracks in the world. They’re slender, dark, and often cold,
          but they are the only things that keep you hidden. Keep you alive.
          They are the shadows of the world, and they are where you live.||You
          are a shadowrunner, thriving in the margins, doing the jobs no one
          else can. You have no office, no permanent home, no background to
          check. You are whatever you make yourself. Will you seek justice? Sow
          seeds of chaos? Sell out to the highest bidder? It’s up to you, but
          this much is certain: If you do nothing, the streets will eat you
          alive.||You can survive, even flourish, as long as you do what it
          takes. Sacrifice part of your soul for bleeding-edge gear. Push the
          limits of your will learning new and dangerous magic. Wire yourself
          into the Matrix, making your mind one with screaming streams of data.
          It’ll cost you something—everything does—but you can make it worth the
          price.

          This power allows an adept to disrupt the mana flows within a target
          they have touched. Activating this power is a Simple Action and can be
          activated any time within (Magic) minutes from the time the target is
          touched (meaning the adept must have succeeded in a touch attack. The
          adept rolls Magic + Willpower [Astral] vs. Reaction + Intuition
          [Physical]. If the adept wins, the target suffers a glitch or accident
          as determined by the gamemaster. If the adept scores 4 or more net
          hits, it is considered a critical glitch with potentially catastrophic
          results. The adept must resist Drain (Body + Willpower) equal to the
          number of hits (not net hits).

          This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide
          variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision
          devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not
          the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social
          camouflage. Even when you aren't wearing the right outfit for a
          situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing
          can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes)
          with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and
          specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended
          Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).

        background:
          gender: |
            I'm male, through no fault of my own. You can blame me papa for that
            one.
          size: |
            I'm short and stout, like a teapot. That's my joke. If I hear any
            short or fat jokes, I'll kneecap you. Yeah, I'm short, even for a
            dwarf, and could lose a few pounds. Hey, chummer, round is a shape.
          description: |
            Ugh, I think the term for it is 'dirty blond', but I call it brown.
            And my eyes are brown as well. Guess I'm full of drek! Yeah, I'm
            super white. Do I look like I go jogging shirtless in the noon sun?
            Frag that noise. I hate the heat and I hate the outside.
          appearance: |
            You ever watch old movies converted to trids? Think of Bombur from
            The Hobbit.
          born: 'Born and raised right here in Phoenix.'
          age: "I'm totally 21. Again. For like, the fourteenth year in a row."
          family: |
            What, you think all dwarves live in tight communities in caves
            they've dug out? That's racist. I bet you think even the women
            dwarves have beards. My family rented a basement apartment in the
            south side of Phoenix for most of my life. They've since relocated…
            elsewhere. I found a nice apartment of my own. Yeah, it's
            underground too, but not because I'm a dwarf. It's because I hate
            that ball of fire in the sky.
          married: |
            I mean, I'm sure one of the groupies from my days touring with
            Hundreddust might have come down with a little bit of pregnancy, but
            if they have they've never asked me for nuttin'.
          education: |
            What is this, twenty questions? I managed to get through most of
            high school before Key Army got signed and I started touring. Not a
            whole lot of time to study when you're a rock star livin' the life,
            eh chummer? After Key Army broke up (not my fault!) I joined Lonely
            Owls which actually was interested in musical theory and
            composition, which is the closest I've come to real musical
            training.
          living: |
            Nope, it didn't snow today. Wait, what? Oh, things I've done for a
            living. You gotta speak up, chummer. You know I was a rock star,
            right? I mean, life on the road was fun and all, but I knew it
            wouldn't last. When our tour bus driver overdosed (again, not my
            fault!) I took over his job, which turned out to be mostly taking
            huge amounts of long haul and not hitting all of the dumb go-gangers
            out on the roads. I ended up really enjoying being behind the wheel,
            and once I got that control rig implanted, I knew what I was doing
            after I hung up the old four-string for good.
          religion: |
            Frag the man, man! And keep your ghost stories to yourself chummer.
          moral: |
            How's the pay? If it pays well I'll sleep okay no matter what.
          goals: |
            What, like Santa bringing a lump instead of a present? Oh, goals.
            Yeah, sure. I got big plans. Mostly involving catchin' some
            adrenalin doin' something fun in my ride. Sure, it's a van, but I
            mean jumping over chasms, not rockin' in the back with a lass.
          why: |
            Where else do you think an ex-rock star would end up? Hundreddust
            broke up years ago, and after that fragger Keanu skipped town with
            most of our earnings, leaving me an Nine Finger Pete trying to avoid
            the record company's lawyers and goons. I didn't know I was supposed
            to actually read that contract they had me sign.
          personality: |
            You haven't figured that out from this interview? And why are you
            asking about me in that weird tense? It's just like I said in
            "Hull State of Mind":

            Hope the foul got some prowl.
            My fowl don't like no dirty owl.
            Run up to the scowl and get the howl.

            In a Hull state of mind.

            Yeah, I already felt more at home jumped in to a vehicle.
          qualities: |
            Other than my rugged good looks and washboard abs? I'm a fraggin'
            awesome driver. Crank the stereo to eleven, feel my mind and the
            machine becoming one, and there ain't no one on the road that can
            catch me. Also, you know as soon as I mention "Master of Devon" you
            get that bass riff stuck in your head. Yeah, I wrote that.
          limitations: |
            Get out of this interview, apparently. Make a joke about reaching
            things on the top shelf and I'll punch you so hard in the baby-maker
            your grandkids will be cross-eyed.
          hate: |
            That jackass Keanu that broke up the band. Seriously, he's like that
            woman that broke up the Beatles back in ancient days.
          love: |
            I said all I could say when I wrote "Mistress of Running":

            Faster than our love
            Terrifying spider
            Enraged and like a demon
            She's half woman and half cider

            She's the one that got away.
          name: |
            Arnond. No, with a silent Q. Of course I'm serious. Most dwarven
            names have silent Qs. Yeah, after the N. I don't care, pick one.
          motivation: |
            Heh, I like Arnond's attitude. And as a 6'2" man in the real world
            that has probably made more than my fair share of short jokes, being
            on the receiving end sounds fun.

          Arc Feedback grants the technomancer the ability to catch some of the
          energy of a successful attack against them and send it back toward the
          attacker.||While a technomancer is sustaining this form, every time
          they receive Matrix damage—that is to say, damage remaining after any
          and all resistance rolls—they roll Software + Resonance [Level] v.
          Willpower + Firewall of the attacker. If the test succeeds, the damage
          the technomancer was not able to resist is reflected back to the
          attacker at a ratio of 1 point of damage for every 2 inflicted on the
          technomancer. Net hits on the test increase the damage, and the total
          damage must be resisted by the original attacker. Damage reflected
          back on the attacker does not reduce the damage taken by the
          technomancer.

          The barghest is a metaspecies of the English mastiff, standing about
          85 centimeters at the shoulder and weighing approximately 170
          kilograms. Its short, sleek fur is either pure white or pure black,
          and it lies flat on its massively muscled body, creating the illusion
          of a naked hide. Sharp spines protrude along the length of its back.
          Its eyes shine red, and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of
          luminescent bacteria in its saliva. During their breeding season, they
          hunt alone or in pairs; at other times they hunt in packs of twelve or
          more. A number of corps have attempted to use barghests as guard
          animals, with mixed results.

    Shadowrun5eCritterPower:
      description: A power a critter can use.
      example:
        action: 'Complex'
        description: |
          Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to
          occur. The exact nature of the accident is for the gamemaster to
          determine, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on
          around him. This power isn’t, in and of itself, dangerous, but
          circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so.
          Tripping on your own feet in front of rush-hour traffic could be
          hazardous to your health, for instance.||When a critter targets
          someone with this power, make an Opposed Test, using the critter’s
          Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Intuition. If the
          critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test. If
          the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a
          critical glitch—it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential
          catastrophe. A critter can use this power on a number of targets at
          once equal to its Magic rating.

          Those that have spent any time in prison may have heard of the 52
          Blocks. It's a mixed martial art style of unarmed strikes and blocks
          within a confined space and possibly handcuffed. The intent of 52
          Blocks is self-defense and survival. The moves are quick and dirty,
          designed for effect and effectiveness, not finesse. It's not a style
          that is taught, especially outside prison and is usually learned the
          hard way.

          point higher than his metatype maximum (for example, a human character
          could raise her Edge to 8). Note that taking this quality does not
          actually increase the character's current Edge rating, it just allows
          her the opportunity to do so; the Karma cost for gaining the extra
          point must still be paid. This quality may only be taken once and must
          be approved by the gamemaster. The Lucky quality cannot be combined

          after the spell is exhausted. Flamethrower is a single-target spell,

            Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a
            resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from
            fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a
            united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to
            forge alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving
            interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of
            the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s
            institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy
            in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful
            reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and
            divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a
            part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.

          Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a
          resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from
          fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a
          united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to forge
          alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving
          interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of
          the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s
          institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy
          in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful
          reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and
          divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a
          part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.

Notoriously cheap and insecure, they’re nonetheless the mainstay of those who can’t afford better.
