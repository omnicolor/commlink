    patch:
      summary: Update a Shadowrun 5E character
      description: Update a Shadowrun character's condition monitor.
      operationId: shadowrun5e-characters-update
      requestBody:
        description: |
          This is a JSON patch document describing what should happen to the
          character sheet.

          Healing a character is done by setting the appropriate damage track
          to 0.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/damagePhysical", "value": 0}
            ]
          }
          ```

          Damaging a character is done by setting the total damage to a given
          track. If they already had 6 stun, this would give them an additional
          4 boxes of stun.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/damageStun", "value": 10}
            ]
          }
          ```
          Applying more stun damage to a character than their condition monitor
          allows automatically converts to the appropriate amount of additional
          physical damage. Similarly, adding more physical damage than their
          physical monitor allows converts to overflow damage.

          Using edge is similar. If a character starts with 3 edge and uses one,
          set the edgeCurrent field to 2.
          ```
          {
            "patch": [
              {"op": "replace", "path": "/edgeCurrent", "value": 2}
            ]
          }
          ```

            Born in the Martian Congressional Republic, your life has been
            influenced by the Martian dream: to terraform the Red Planet into a
            lush and life-sustaining garden. Like the generations before you,
            you know that you will likely never see the completion of this work
            in your lifetime. As a Martian, your character has the following
            traits:||• Your native gravity is low, the gravity of Mars rather
            than Earth. Martians are more comfortable with microgravity than
            Earthers, and better able to tolerate a full 1 g than Belters,
            operating in-between.

            A measure of comfort and security comes with the middle class. A
            steady job, often skilled labor or “white collar,” supplies the
            means to afford a few luxuries or non-essentials. Middle class
            characters might start off as a bit insular. They often separate
            themselves from the struggles of the lower social classes, focusing

            to a slip. They tumble down to the lower class or even become

          them out of utter poverty. They might live in failing industrial
          areas, inner city slums, or hardscrabble farms. In all cases, they
          make do with what is available and find ways to stretch out resources
          until the next payday or job comes along.

          touched (meaning the adept must have succeeded in a touch attack. The
          adept rolls Magic + Willpower [Astral] vs. Reaction + Intuition

          results. The adept must resist Drain (Body + Willpower) equal to the

          This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide
          variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision
          devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not
          the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social
          camouflage. Even when you aren't wearing the right outfit for a
          situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing
          can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes)
          with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and
          specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended
          Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).

          A datajack gives you a direct neural interface (p. 222), which can be
          handy in a lot of situations. It also comes with a retractable spool
          of micro-cable (about a meter long) that lets you directly interface
          with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are
          equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or
          saving files. Two datajack users can string a fiberoptic cable between
          themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio
          interception or eavesdropping.||Wireless: The datajack gives you

        background:
          gender: |
            I'm male, through no fault of my own. You can blame me papa for that
            one.
          size: |
            I'm short and stout, like a teapot. That's my joke. If I hear any
            short or fat jokes, I'll kneecap you. Yeah, I'm short, even for a
            dwarf, and could lose a few pounds. Hey, chummer, round is a shape.
          description: |
            Ugh, I think the term for it is 'dirty blond', but I call it brown.
            And my eyes are brown as well. Guess I'm full of drek! Yeah, I'm
            super white. Do I look like I go jogging shirtless in the noon sun?
            Frag that noise. I hate the heat and I hate the outside.
          appearance: |
            You ever watch old movies converted to trids? Think of Bombur from
            The Hobbit.
          born: 'Born and raised right here in Phoenix.'
          age: "I'm totally 21. Again. For like, the fourteenth year in a row."
          family: |
            What, you think all dwarves live in tight communities in caves
            they've dug out? That's racist. I bet you think even the women
            dwarves have beards. My family rented a basement apartment in the
            south side of Phoenix for most of my life. They've since relocated…
            elsewhere. I found a nice apartment of my own. Yeah, it's
            underground too, but not because I'm a dwarf. It's because I hate
            that ball of fire in the sky.
          married: |
            I mean, I'm sure one of the groupies from my days touring with
            Hundreddust might have come down with a little bit of pregnancy, but
            if they have they've never asked me for nuttin'.
          education: |
            What is this, twenty questions? I managed to get through most of
            high school before Key Army got signed and I started touring. Not a
            whole lot of time to study when you're a rock star livin' the life,
            eh chummer? After Key Army broke up (not my fault!) I joined Lonely
            Owls which actually was interested in musical theory and
            composition, which is the closest I've come to real musical
            training.
          living: |
            Nope, it didn't snow today. Wait, what? Oh, things I've done for a
            living. You gotta speak up, chummer. You know I was a rock star,
            right? I mean, life on the road was fun and all, but I knew it
            wouldn't last. When our tour bus driver overdosed (again, not my
            fault!) I took over his job, which turned out to be mostly taking
            huge amounts of long haul and not hitting all of the dumb go-gangers
            out on the roads. I ended up really enjoying being behind the wheel,
            and once I got that control rig implanted, I knew what I was doing
            after I hung up the old four-string for good.
          religion: |
            Frag the man, man! And keep your ghost stories to yourself chummer.
          moral: |
            How's the pay? If it pays well I'll sleep okay no matter what.
          goals: |
            What, like Santa bringing a lump instead of a present? Oh, goals.
            Yeah, sure. I got big plans. Mostly involving catchin' some
            adrenalin doin' something fun in my ride. Sure, it's a van, but I
            mean jumping over chasms, not rockin' in the back with a lass.
          why: |
            Where else do you think an ex-rock star would end up? Hundreddust
            broke up years ago, and after that fragger Keanu skipped town with
            most of our earnings, leaving me an Nine Finger Pete trying to avoid
            the record company's lawyers and goons. I didn't know I was supposed
            to actually read that contract they had me sign.
          personality: |
            You haven't figured that out from this interview? And why are you
            asking about me in that weird tense? It's just like I said in
            "Hull State of Mind":

            Hope the foul got some prowl.
            My fowl don't like no dirty owl.
            Run up to the scowl and get the howl.

            In a Hull state of mind.

            Yeah, I already felt more at home jumped in to a vehicle.
          qualities: |
            Other than my rugged good looks and washboard abs? I'm a fraggin'
            awesome driver. Crank the stereo to eleven, feel my mind and the
            machine becoming one, and there ain't no one on the road that can
            catch me. Also, you know as soon as I mention "Master of Devon" you
            get that bass riff stuck in your head. Yeah, I wrote that.
          limitations: |
            Get out of this interview, apparently. Make a joke about reaching
            things on the top shelf and I'll punch you so hard in the baby-maker
            your grandkids will be cross-eyed.
          hate: |
            That jackass Keanu that broke up the band. Seriously, he's like that
            woman that broke up the Beatles back in ancient days.
          love: |
            I said all I could say when I wrote "Mistress of Running":

            Faster than our love
            Terrifying spider
            Enraged and like a demon
            She's half woman and half cider

            She's the one that got away.
          name: |
            Arnond. No, with a silent Q. Of course I'm serious. Most dwarven
            names have silent Qs. Yeah, after the N. I don't care, pick one.
          motivation: |
            Heh, I like Arnond's attitude. And as a 6'2" man in the real world
            that has probably made more than my fair share of short jokes, being
            on the receiving end sounds fun.

          Arc Feedback grants the technomancer the ability to catch some of the
          energy of a successful attack against them and send it back toward the
          attacker.||While a technomancer is sustaining this form, every time
          they receive Matrix damage—that is to say, damage remaining after any
          and all resistance rolls—they roll Software + Resonance [Level] v.
          Willpower + Firewall of the attacker. If the test succeeds, the damage
          the technomancer was not able to resist is reflected back to the
          attacker at a ratio of 1 point of damage for every 2 inflicted on the
          technomancer. Net hits on the test increase the damage, and the total
          damage must be resisted by the original attacker. Damage reflected
          back on the attacker does not reduce the damage taken by the
          technomancer.

          The barghest is a metaspecies of the English mastiff, standing about
          85 centimeters at the shoulder and weighing approximately 170
          kilograms. Its short, sleek fur is either pure white or pure black,
          and it lies flat on its massively muscled body, creating the illusion
          of a naked hide. Sharp spines protrude along the length of its back.
          Its eyes shine red, and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of
          luminescent bacteria in its saliva. During their breeding season, they
          hunt alone or in pairs; at other times they hunt in packs of twelve or
          more. A number of corps have attempted to use barghests as guard
          animals, with mixed results.

      example:
        action: 'Complex'
        description: |
          Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to
          occur. The exact nature of the accident is for the gamemaster to
          determine, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on
          around him. This power isn’t, in and of itself, dangerous, but
          circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so.
          Tripping on your own feet in front of rush-hour traffic could be
          hazardous to your health, for instance.||When a critter targets
          someone with this power, make an Opposed Test, using the critter’s
          Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Intuition. If the
          critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test. If
          the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a
          critical glitch—it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential
          catastrophe. A critter can use this power on a number of targets at
          once equal to its Magic rating.

          These are the kind of knuckle-dragging, slope-browed Neanderthals that
          typify the phrase “angry mob.” They’re employed by the likes of the
          Humanis policlub or TerraFirst!, or they simply coalesce on the street
          whenever something bad is about to happen. They’re used to rough up
          and intimidate random groups of people. They’re no match for an
          experienced combatant, however, and if they meet any real resistance,
          they’re out of there.

          These spells create an explosion of flames that flash into existence
          and scorch the target(s), giving them the double benefit of causing
          pain and being intimidating as hell. These spells deal Fire damage
          (p.171).These flames burn out after striking the target, but their
          secondary effects may ignite flammable materials that continue to burn
          after the spell is exhausted. Flamethrower is a single-target spell,
          while Fireball is an area spell.
