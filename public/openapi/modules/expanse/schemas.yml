    origin:
      description: |
        Born in the Martian Congressional Republic, your life has been
        influenced by the Martian dream: to terraform the Red Planet into a
        lush and life-sustaining garden. Like the generations before you,
        you know that you will likely never see the completion of this work
        in your lifetime. As a Martian, your character has the following
        traits:||• Your native gravity is low, the gravity of Mars rather
        than Earth. Martians are more comfortable with microgravity than
        Earthers, and better able to tolerate a full 1 g than Belters,
        operating in-between.
      name: Martian
    profession: Scavenger
    quality: Humility
    social_class:
      description: |
        A measure of comfort and security comes with the middle class. A
        steady job, often skilled labor or “white collar,” supplies the
        means to afford a few luxuries or non-essentials. Middle class
        characters might start off as a bit insular. They often separate
        themselves from the struggles of the lower social classes, focusing
        on the climb towards upper class status. Sometimes that climb leads
        to a slip. They tumble down to the lower class or even become
        outsiders. Some settle for stability instead, and prefer not to rock
        the boat.

SocialClass:
  example:
    description: |
      Hard, usually physical, labor and precarious employment tend to rule
      the lives of lower class characters. Still, that work is often all
      that separates them from becoming outsiders, so they cling to it.
      Lower class characters often depend on family and friends to help keep
      them out of utter poverty. They might live in failing industrial
      areas, inner city slums, or hardscrabble farms. In all cases, they
      make do with what is available and find ways to stretch out resources
      until the next payday or job comes along.

Talent:
  example:
    benefits:
      novice: When you select this talent, increase your Income by +2.
      expert: |
        When you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You may add 2
        to your Income score when comparing your score with an item’s cost
        to purchase it automatically, without a test, or to determine
        whether the purchase will deplete your Income. You enjoy this
        benefit only once per game session, and you must choose whether it
        applies to an automatic purchase or to avoid depleting your Income.
      master: |
        When you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You can
        re-roll a failed Income test, but must keep the result of the
        second roll.
