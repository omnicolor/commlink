AdeptPower:
  example:
    cost: 0.5
    description: |
      This power allows an adept to disrupt the mana flows within a target
      they have touched. Activating this power is a Simple Action and can be
      activated any time within (Magic) minutes from the time the target is
      touched (meaning the adept must have succeeded in a touch attack. The
      adept rolls Magic + Willpower [Astral] vs. Reaction + Intuition
      [Physical]. If the adept wins, the target suffers a glitch or accident
      as determined by the gamemaster. If the adept scores 4 or more net
      hits, it is considered a critical glitch with potentially catastrophic
      results. The adept must resist Drain (Body + Willpower) equal to the
      number of hits (not net hits).

      This enhancement enables your armor and clothing to display a wide
      variety of AR overlays. Due to the ubiquity of AR-enabled vision
      devices, most people will see the look you choose to display and not
      the clothes you are actually wearing. This can serve as useful social
      camouflage. Even when you aren't wearing the right outfit for a
      situation, you can look like you are. Creating your own AR clothing
      can be done with an Artisan + Intuition Extended Test (30 minutes)
      with a threshold set by the gamemaster based on the complexity and
      specificity of the overlay you are attempting to create (per Extended
      Test Threshold Table, p. 48, SR5).

      equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or

    background:
      gender: |
        I'm male, through no fault of my own. You can blame me papa for that
        one.
      size: |
        I'm short and stout, like a teapot. That's my joke. If I hear any
        short or fat jokes, I'll kneecap you. Yeah, I'm short, even for a
        dwarf, and could lose a few pounds. Hey, chummer, round is a shape.
      description: |
        Ugh, I think the term for it is 'dirty blond', but I call it brown.
        And my eyes are brown as well. Guess I'm full of drek! Yeah, I'm
        super white. Do I look like I go jogging shirtless in the noon sun?
        Frag that noise. I hate the heat and I hate the outside.
      appearance: |
        You ever watch old movies converted to trids? Think of Bombur from
        The Hobbit.
      born: Born and raised right here in Phoenix.
      age: I'm totally 21. Again. For like, the fourteenth year in a row.
      family: |
        What, you think all dwarves live in tight communities in caves
        they've dug out? That's racist. I bet you think even the women
        dwarves have beards. My family rented a basement apartment in the
        south side of Phoenix for most of my life. They've since relocated…
        elsewhere. I found a nice apartment of my own. Yeah, it's
        underground too, but not because I'm a dwarf. It's because I hate
        that ball of fire in the sky.
      married: |
        I mean, I'm sure one of the groupies from my days touring with
        Hundreddust might have come down with a little bit of pregnancy, but
        if they have they've never asked me for nuttin'.
      education: |
        What is this, twenty questions? I managed to get through most of
        high school before Key Army got signed and I started touring. Not a
        whole lot of time to study when you're a rock star livin' the life,
        eh chummer? After Key Army broke up (not my fault!) I joined Lonely
        Owls which actually was interested in musical theory and
        composition, which is the closest I've come to real musical
        training.
      living: |
        Nope, it didn't snow today. Wait, what? Oh, things I've done for a
        living. You gotta speak up, chummer. You know I was a rock star,
        right? I mean, life on the road was fun and all, but I knew it
        wouldn't last. When our tour bus driver overdosed (again, not my
        fault!) I took over his job, which turned out to be mostly taking
        huge amounts of long haul and not hitting all of the dumb go-gangers
        out on the roads. I ended up really enjoying being behind the wheel,
        and once I got that control rig implanted, I knew what I was doing
        after I hung up the old four-string for good.
      religion: |
        Frag the man, man! And keep your ghost stories to yourself chummer.
      moral: |
        How's the pay? If it pays well I'll sleep okay no matter what.
      goals: |
        What, like Santa bringing a lump instead of a present? Oh, goals.
        Yeah, sure. I got big plans. Mostly involving catchin' some
        adrenalin doin' something fun in my ride. Sure, it's a van, but I
        mean jumping over chasms, not rockin' in the back with a lass.
      why: |
        Where else do you think an ex-rock star would end up? Hundreddust
        broke up years ago, and after that fragger Keanu skipped town with
        most of our earnings, leaving me an Nine Finger Pete trying to avoid
        the record company's lawyers and goons. I didn't know I was supposed
        to actually read that contract they had me sign.
      personality: |
        You haven't figured that out from this interview? And why are you
        asking about me in that weird tense? It's just like I said in
        "Hull State of Mind":

        Hope the foul got some prowl.
        My fowl don't like no dirty owl.
        Run up to the scowl and get the howl.

        In a Hull state of mind.

        Yeah, I already felt more at home jumped in to a vehicle.
      qualities: |
        Other than my rugged good looks and washboard abs? I'm a fraggin'
        awesome driver. Crank the stereo to eleven, feel my mind and the
        machine becoming one, and there ain't no one on the road that can
        catch me. Also, you know as soon as I mention "Master of Devon" you
        get that bass riff stuck in your head. Yeah, I wrote that.
      limitations: |
        Get out of this interview, apparently. Make a joke about reaching
        things on the top shelf and I'll punch you so hard in the baby-maker
        your grandkids will be cross-eyed.
      hate: |
        That jackass Keanu that broke up the band. Seriously, he's like that
        woman that broke up the Beatles back in ancient days.
      love: |
        I said all I could say when I wrote "Mistress of Running":

        Faster than our love
        Terrifying spider
        Enraged and like a demon
        She's half woman and half cider

        She's the one that got away.
      name: |
        Arnond. No, with a silent Q. Of course I'm serious. Most dwarven
        names have silent Qs. Yeah, after the N. I don't care, pick one.
      motivation: |
        Heh, I like Arnond's attitude. And as a 6'2" man in the real world
        that has probably made more than my fair share of short jokes, being
        on the receiving end sounds fun.

      they receive Matrix damage—that is to say, damage remaining after any
      and all resistance rolls—they roll Software + Resonance [Level] v.
      Willpower + Firewall of the attacker. If the test succeeds, the damage
      the technomancer was not able to resist is reflected back to the
      attacker at a ratio of 1 point of damage for every 2 inflicted on the
      technomancer. Net hits on the test increase the damage, and the total
      damage must be resisted by the original attacker. Damage reflected
      back on the attacker does not reduce the damage taken by the
      technomancer.

      The barghest is a metaspecies of the English mastiff, standing about
      85 centimeters at the shoulder and weighing approximately 170
      kilograms. Its short, sleek fur is either pure white or pure black,
      and it lies flat on its massively muscled body, creating the illusion
      of a naked hide. Sharp spines protrude along the length of its back.
      Its eyes shine red, and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of
      luminescent bacteria in its saliva. During their breeding season, they
      hunt alone or in pairs; at other times they hunt in packs of twelve or
      more. A number of corps have attempted to use barghests as guard
      animals, with mixed results.

CritterPower:
  description: A power a critter can use.
  example:
    action: Complex
    description: |
      Critters with this power can cause seemingly normal accidents to
      occur. The exact nature of the accident is for the gamemaster to
      determine, based on what the target is doing and what’s going on
      around him. This power isn’t, in and of itself, dangerous, but
      circumstance and environment can come into play to make it so.
      Tripping on your own feet in front of rush-hour traffic could be
      hazardous to your health, for instance.||When a critter targets
      someone with this power, make an Opposed Test, using the critter’s
      Magic + Willpower against the target’s Reaction + Intuition. If the
      critter wins, treat it as if the target rolled a glitch on a test. If
      the critter scores 4 or more net hits, the accident is treated as a
      critical glitch—it’s not just an embarrassing fumble, it’s a potential
      catastrophe. A critter can use this power on a number of targets at
      once equal to its Magic rating.

      Quite popular among shadowrunners is a room dedicated to guns. Ammo
      and one stock firearm duplicating one that the character purchased at
      the character creation are on hand in this room. If the character has
      purchased a toolkit that can work on the particular weapon, 1 point of
      Accuracy or AP can be repaired per week without additional cost. A
      point of Reach can also be repaired in two weeks.

      Those that have spent any time in prison may have heard of the 52
      Blocks. It's a mixed martial art style of unarmed strikes and blocks
      within a confined space and possibly handcuffed. The intent of 52
      Blocks is self-defense and survival. The moves are quick and dirty,
      designed for effect and effectiveness, not finesse. It's not a style
      that is taught, especially outside prison and is usually learned the
      hard way.

      long as it’s not subtle. Reduce negative dice pool modifiers by your

      point higher than his metatype maximum (for example, a human character
      could raise her Edge to 8). Note that taking this quality does not
      actually increase the character's current Edge rating, it just allows
      her the opportunity to do so; the Karma cost for gaining the extra
      point must still be paid. This quality may only be taken once and must

      The AK-97 is a legendary weapon with storied reliability—you can bury
      it for ten years, dig it up, and fire it immediately without a single
      problem. When all of the nano-fabricated AK–174s melted to slag, the
      AK-97s kept functioning just fine.
