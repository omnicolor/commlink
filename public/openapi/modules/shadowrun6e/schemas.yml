      to the level of the power, which you can resist as normal.

      magician: Edge Boosts cost 1 less for Health spells, preparations, and Health spell rituals
      adept: 1 free level of Rapid Healing
    description: |
      This mentor symbolizes strength and protection. He is a healer and
      cannot turn down those in need without good reason, and he defends those
      under his care. Bear also has a fierce side; he is a dedicated
      protector, disregarding his own safety in combat if wounded or if
      someone he is protecting is injured.
    disadvantages: |
      You might go berserk when you take Physical damage in combat or if
      someone under your care is badly injured. Make a Charisma + Willpower
      Test (wound modifiers apply). You go berserk for 3 combat rounds minus 1
      round per hit, so 3 or more hits averts the berserk rage entirely. If
      you’re already going berserk, increase the duration. When you’re berserk,
      you go after your attackers without regard for your own safety. If you
      incapacitate the targets before the time is up, the berserk fury
      dissipates.

      Adept centering allows you to overcome possible negatives from adverse
      conditions, such as poor lighting, challenging environment, or even
      swirling illusions. By performing a centering action, you retain your
      focus so that your opponents cannot take advantage of you. When acting
      against you, opponents cannot gain Edge from advantages due to
      environmental conditions, or from changes in Attack or Defense Ratings
      tied to Illusion spells on your turn when you perform a centering
      action, or their next turn after the action was performed. The
      centering action can be simple, but it should be obvious to anyone who
      is paying attention. Maybe it’s singing, chanting, making ritualistic
      hand gestures, whatever. As long as it aligns mind with body, it’s
      good. Performing your centering action requires a Minor Action.

      As the majority of the sentient beings of the world, humans create
      existing definitions of “normal,” and then some of them set out to abuse
      those definitions as hard as they can. These humans know that they lack
      the pure physical strength and social cohesion of some of the other
      metatypes, so they shape the world in a way that keeps the individuals
      they don’t like from ever realizing what they can do, and what they can
      become.

      The side effect of this, of course, is that many humans are caught up in
      the demoralizing machinery that the ruling corporate class has assembled,
      because they don’t fit into this artificial average. They are grist for
      the mill, people to be chewed up and spat out in the name of greater
      wealth and power for the people at the top. Because they’re humans, and
      there are so many of them, who’s going to notice how they’re ground down,
      and who is going to miss them when they’re gone?

      The shadows are full of humans who could not find a way to be normal or
      average.
