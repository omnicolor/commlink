    description: You can convert code-based intelligences to your cause. Burn 4 GRT and roll a REA and a CHA check. The difficulty of the REA check is 1 + the complexity level of the code-based intelligence (generally at least a 3). The CHA check is a standard difficulty of 6. If both checks are successful, you convince the code-based intelligence to ally with you and accomplish some goal. This is a permanent alliance, unless you double-cross the AI. If one check succeeds, the AI is not angry, simply unconvinced—perhaps curious about the terms of the alliance. If both checks fail, you have angered the AI and should probably flee…

Cost to command a vessel is based purely on its class (a combined 1–6 rating based on its size, complexity, and condition), with each point of vessel class costing 6 GRT. Burning this GRT grants you the ability to pilot or otherwise command the ship, within reason. (If the hyperdrive’s broke, it ain’t jumpin; mining vessels may not sport armament, etc.) While piloting, you are essentially stuck and unable to otherwise venture. You must pay the astrogation cost each time you chart a course into or out of a system, or each time the ship is damaged or upgraded. Doing anything with the ship other than moving from point A to B (firing weapons, scanning a mysterious craft, remotely salvaging damaged life support systems, etc.) requires relevant checks, typically REA or, in a dogfight, COM and MOV.

You can bring 1 +your level humanoid-sized beings along with you to safety, or burn an additional 6 GRT to bring one additional being beyond your limit. Small sapient beings (0.5-M tall/long) count for half a slot; large sapes (3-M tall/long) count double; small pets (cat/beagle-sized) are free.
