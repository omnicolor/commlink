        You’ve held true to a core of conviction even while getting your
        hands dirty to do what you deemed necessary. But balance means
        appreciating that other people are just as complex as you are, not
        merely obstacles or pawns. Tell the GM how you solve an intractable
        problem or calm a terrible conflict by relating to dangerous people
        on a human level.

Status:
  example:
    description: |
      Doomed is the status for when you’re drowning, or when you’re on fire,
      or when the stone around you isn’t simply immobilizing you—it’s
      crushing you. It represents a constant, ongoing pressure upon you,
      causing you to mark fatigue at a steady rate until you are free. The
      GM decides exactly how often you mark fatigue during play, unless
      you’re in exchanges—then, you should mark 1-fatigue at the beginning
      of each exchange. Remember that if you can’t mark more fatigue, you
      mark conditions instead.

      Much of the time, you can’t be Doomed unless you’re first Impaired, or
      Impaired and Trapped. You won’t be drowning unless something holds you
      in the water; you won’t be slowly crushed by rock without first being
      trapped in rock. But sometimes it’s appropriate—your entire outfit,
      head to toe, can be set on fire by an angry firebending master without
      warning!
