      description: |
        Originating on the planet Earth in the Sol system, Humans are a
        resilient, diverse, and adaptable species, who developed from
        fractious, warring nations on the brink of mutual annihilation to a
        united, peaceful society in less than a century, and managed to
        forge alliances between former enemies within a century of achieving
        interstellar space flight. Earth is a founder and pivotal member of
        the United Federation of Planets, and many of the Federation’s
        institutions can be found on Earth. Humans often exhibit a dichotomy
        in their nature — being both driven to strong emotion and careful
        reason — and while they have largely grown beyond their warlike and
        divisive past, their drive and capacity for aggression are as much a
        part of their success as their curiosity and analytical minds.
