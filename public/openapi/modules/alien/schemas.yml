      Standard issue for the USCMC, the Mk.35 is an unfortunately bulky
      combat pressure suit with a cumbersome recycler unit. You want to be
      careful wearing one of these in a fight, as the hard joints tend to
      seize up with extreme motion. While the inexpensive suit offers full
      protection from the vacuum of space, you have to spend time in a
      decompression chamber after spacewalking in one. Basically, this suit
      sucks, but if the choice is a Mk.35 or the cold of space, shut up and
      suit up. Armor Rating 5, Maximum Air Supply 4. Heavy item.

    description: |
      Most of your friends will never see another world… but not you. As
      soon as you were old enough, you signed up for the USCMC. The pay is
      crap and the food is worse, but you’ve always got a bunk to sleep in
      and you get to shoot all sorts of weapons at all sorts of things. Life
      in the Corps is never dull—but the luster has begun to fade. You’ve
      seen things that you’ll never be able to forget, and plenty you wish
      you could.

          Between fights, you release the tension in your team with some
          friendly banter. Your STRESS LEVEL, and the STRESS LEVEL of
          everyone in SHORT range of you, drops two steps (instead of one)
          for every Turn spent in a safe place (see page 104). Having
          several Marines with this talent doesn’t increase the effect.

      You can roll for OBSERVATION to gain insight regarding strange and

      study for at least one Turn. For every you roll, you get to ask the GM
      one of the questions below.||Is it human or alien?||Is it dead or
      alive?||How old is it?||What is its purpose?||How does it work?||What
      problems could it cause?||The GM must answer truthfully, but is
      allowed to give vague or incomplete answers in order to avoid spoiling
      the scenario.|| A successful Analyze roll also reduces the STRESS
      LEVEL of all other PCs within SHORT range by one, while a failed roll
      increases other PCs' stress levels by one.
